# blood centre

This project is going to serve as a electronic blood donations service.

Users will be able to:
* activate accounts
* get a list of donations they done before
* see donation centers near them
* get notified when a center is in need for blood units that matches theirs

> this project is our submission project for the Software Engineering course 2019/2020 at IUG.
